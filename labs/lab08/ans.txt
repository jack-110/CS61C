ex1
	1. virtual address has five bits offsets, so the page size is 32bytes.
	2. TLB Hits 4, Miss 6; Page Hits 0, Faults 6.
	3. No. Because physical memory size = TLB size = 4, there always only have 4 entries are valid and cached in TLB. 
	we cann't think of any set of ten address that would result in page hit.
	4. VA => VPN, then TLB Miss; walk page table, and page faluts; load the page in disk into main memory, and update
	page table„ÄÅTLB.
ex2
	00 20 40 60 80 A0 C0 E0 00 20.
	Reason1: Just as we explained in the last question, entries in page table are all cached in TLB.
	Reason2: the ten address don't access the same page in a four pags cycle.

ex3
	memory size, because memory size is four, so the page table only have 4 valid entries and it's the same in TLB. If we can increase the memory size, we can add more entries than TLB.

ex4
	p1 p2 p3 p4 represents different processes!
	because the va is bigger.
